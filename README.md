Repository renamed
==================

Dummy repository for repository rename from unburden_home_dir to unburden-home-dir.

Go to https://github.com/xtaran/unburden-home-dir instead.

Reasoning
=========

Too often I couldn't remember if I used unburden_home_dir or
unburden-home-dir because I chose unburden_home_dir initially, but the
Debian package had to be named unburden-home-dir so chaos was waiting
to happen (and happened).
